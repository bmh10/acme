- All interfaces and interface definitions should be commented using the same style.
- Class properties or members need only be commented if their name is not obvious.
- All interfaces should be have a name prefixed by 'I'.
- All tests should have a name suffixed by 'Tests'.
- All unit test class names should contain the name of the class they are testing.
- All tests should be placed in a separate package named 'tests'.
- The Logger should be turned off for all tests.
- Logging should only be done to warn for invalid states or to provide information at important points in execution (i.e. not in every method).
